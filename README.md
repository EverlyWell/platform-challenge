# Platform-challenge

### Overview
This project describes a situation that you may face in your day-to-day work at Everlywell. The goal of this project is to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to solve problems, support your conclusions and communicate to stakeholders.

### Requirements
* Spend no more than 4 hours on the project
* Fork this project and work in your repo
* The tools you use to accomplish the project are your choosing
* You would need access to compute and storage resources to execute this project
* You would be required to speak to your process and decisions in carrying out this project

### Scenario
#### Part 1
Imagine that you joined Everlywell at the early stages of modernizing their application. Currently, they have a Rails application that uses postgres database that is hosted on a virtual machine.

Deployments are a manual which involves signing into the virtual machine, pulling down the most recent deployment branch and restarting the web server. 

This workflow is slow and cumbersome, and the company wants you to come up with a way to deploy the api on Kubernetes to take advantage of its many benefits. 

A copy of the rails app is located in this repo in the folder `rails_app`.

#### Submission
Submission for this project should be on an actual kubernetes cluster with the app deployed on it. At the time of presentation, we should be able to view the app by entering an IP or a DNS name. All supporting code should be checked into your forked repo.

You should be able to show the final product and delve hands-on into the tools you used in real-time.

#### Part 2
The data team needs to run some analysis on a database. They ask you to provision a database daily from the most recent RDS snapshot. When the newly created database is ready for connections, run some analytics queries located on an instance in the same VPC. When the queries are done successfully executing and all the useful analysis has been extracted, delete the provisioned RDS instance for this purpose.

Given the above problem, how would you approach fulfilling the request of the data team, assuming that the tasks would take 2 hours to execute end-to-end and the task will need to be repeated daily. 

#### Submission
The submission should be in the form of a presentation, with a supporting architectural diagram explaining the proposed solution for tackling this repeatable task.

### Bonus
Design a deployment pipeline to deploy the rails app to your kubernetes cluster when new code is pushed to its remote branch.
